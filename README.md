CaptionerJs
==============================================================================
Beautiful and semantically correct captions

Getting Started
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jajascript library to show fancy labels for your image or other elements


Why another caption plugin ?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are lots of caption plugins out there but CaptionerJs was built with code quality in mind.

CaptionerJs won't burry your image inside layers of ```div's```, instead it makes use of ```figure``` and
 ```figcaption``` to produce uncluttered and semantically correct HTML.

You can write valid HTML, CaptionerJs will make use of ```title``` and ```alt```
attributes to create the caption

CaptionerJs is plugin based, you can easily add new caption types
